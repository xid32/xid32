### 🔍 Research

My research focuses on **multimodal learning** for video, audio, and language understanding. I have developed methods for multimodal reasoning, efficient multimodal learning, and generative multimodal modeling, aiming to build scalable and generalizable multimodal models that advance multimodal question answering, video understanding, and audio–visual reasoning across complex real-world scenarios and dynamic environments. Highlights of my work include:
